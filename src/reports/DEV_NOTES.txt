> You should use InputRef to be able to reference and get the value of TextField. 
Also you need to use "current" to be able get the referenced TextField.

> I created a main ReportApp.js and applied Routers, Route, SWitch, navigation components
in this file. Switch is required to prevent React uploading a page (component) under another.
I used LÄ°nks with Buttons to visit the paths created with Route component.

> I deleted useCallbacks with onChange methods inside TextField in upload page. Because it was making the 
page very slow. I used refs to get the vlaue from the TextField and changed the title and description with this
value. I changed the vlaues in onAddReport callback and created the item inside useEffect. Otherwise it changes
title and description but using the one former vlaues of these variables.
